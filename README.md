# Inspetoria Online - Frontend

_Inspetoria Online_ is a web application to help my wife with her job of visiting schools to check if they are following State's legislation (and advise them in case they're not).

This repository contains an AngularJS v2 application that access the backend service to retrieve and save stuff. This is my first real-world angularjs application.

Basically, an **Admin** or **Inspetor** user is able to add schools and users (and associate users to schools). The next step is to schedule visits to the schools and record activities for each visit, so that the **Inspetor** can (in the future) generate the necessary reports for the job.
